Practice Python - Create some program solutions using Python

1. TicTacToe Game - This zip file will guide you and give you a basic idea of designing a game TicTacToe using the pygame library of Python. Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games.  It includes computer graphics and sound libraries designed to be used with the Python programming language. Let’s break the task in five parts:
   -> Importing the required libraries and setting up the required global variables.
   -> Designing the game display function, that will set a platform for other components to be displayed on the screen.
   -> Main algorithm of win and draw
   -> Getting the user input and displaying the “X” or “O” at the proper position where the user has clicked his mouse.
   -> Running an infinite loop, and including the defined methods in it.
2. RockPaperScissor Game - This zip file will guide you through how we can create a Rock Paper and Scissor game using Tkinter library in Python. Python offers multiple options for developing a GUI (Graphical User Interface). Out of all the GUI methods, Tkinter is the most commonly used method. Tkinter is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python. Python with Tkinter is the fastest and easiest way to create GUI applications.
   -> Create a head label that will show the title of the game, set its font and properties
   -> Below the head, label create a user label that will show the hand sign selected by the user
   -> Create a computer label that will show a hand sign picked by the computer
   -> In between the user and the computer label create a label to show the text “vs”
   -> Create a result label to show the result set font and other properties to it
   -> Create three pushbuttons for rock, paper, and scissors respectively
   -> Create a reset button to reset the game.
